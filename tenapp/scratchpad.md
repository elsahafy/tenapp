# Lessons

- For website image paths, always use the correct relative path (e.g., 'images/filename.png') and ensure the images directory exists
- For search results, ensure proper handling of different character encodings (UTF-8) for international queries
- Add debug information to stderr while keeping the main output clean in stdout for better pipeline integration
- When using seaborn styles in matplotlib, use 'seaborn-v0_8' instead of 'seaborn' as the style name due to recent seaborn version changes
- When using Jest, a test suite can fail even if all individual tests pass, typically due to issues in suite-level setup code or lifecycle hooks
- For consistent UI design, use these icon sizes:
  - Regular icons: 16px (h-4 w-4)
  - Empty state icons: 20px (h-5 w-5)
  - Feature icons: 24px (h-6 w-6)
- Use gradient backgrounds (from-white to-gray-50) for cards with border-gray-100 for consistency
